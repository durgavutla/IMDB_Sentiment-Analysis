# IMDB_Sentiment-Analysis
Here, I am going to create a machine learning model that will predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. This is known as binary text classification and will help us explore the scikit-learn library while building a basic machine learning model from scratch.

Problem Statement: My goal is to find which machine learning model is best suited to predict sentiment (output) given a movie review (input).

Closing Thoughts
I would like to experiment with Tensorflow using a lower level API, and not relying on the higher level API in Keras.

That being said, Keras is amazing at prototyping and getting started on a wide range of machine learning problems. I think it is beneficial to start with keras to get a sense of the problem you are working with, and then work down from there. I think it would be interesting to mess with other embedding layers, create a custom embedding layer, experiment with different model structures, and training parameters.
